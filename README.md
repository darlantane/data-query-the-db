# Query the Database

Now it is time to make advanced SQL requests to an `ecommerce` database!

Open the notebook and get started!

You can use the VS Code SQLite extension to explore the database (once you downloaded the database):

- Hit `Ctrl-Shift-P` or `Cmd-Shift-P`
- Start typing until you see `SQLite: Open Database`
- `Enter`
- Select the database file from the dropdown
- In the bottom left corner, click on `SQLITE EXPLORER`
